# Learning Scala - First Tutorial on Akka HTTP and Akka Streams

This is my first attempt at creating a REST service using Akka. I have only implemented the first part of the original tutorial by Jos Dirksen [Building a REST Service in Scala with Akka HTTP, Akka Streams and Reactive Mongo](https://dzone.com/articles/building-rest-service-scala), upgraded to Akka Stream and HTTP 2.0-M1.
